            <p>Hi, my name is Samuel Vega and I'm 21 years old in this January 2025, my birthday is december 20th, it used to be great because I got gifs on my birthday and 5 days later too, until a certain year not anymore, only one gift a year :!</p>
            <p>I studied elementary school in Agua Prieta because I was born in Obregon but grew up in Agua Prieta, when I was 8 years old, my parents decided to move back to Obregon and here I continued with my school, then I studied at Secundaria Tecnica N. 11, there are many crazy anecdotes from those times.</p>
            <p>I studied highschool at Cetis 69, which often semelled like cookies, I studied programming. At first I didn't understand a thing, but over time I understood that it was just about logic and from then on I did better and became quite good among my classmates.</p>
            <p>When I started at Cetis with Java, I loved programming and that's why I decided to study Software Ingeneering and I hope to graduate in a couple of semesters whit no problems and be able to work in this field and continue learning during my working life, you learn something all the time.</p>        </div>
